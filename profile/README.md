This growing archive also serves to honor the stories, memories, and lives of our friends.

PCVs may use the English translation following each testimony (and written in each episode description) to record testimonies again in local language for use with support groups in any Peace Corps country. In fact, we encourage it.

We would also encourage you to record new testimonies with your own support groups for inclusion here. Stories may be anonymous or public, of course.
